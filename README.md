I am currently enrolled in a Data Science class with CareerEra. For the first project, I am reviewing a large dataset, preprocessing the data, and training a random forest machine learning model.

The dataset contains patient information such as age, health conditions, and details of medical treatments provided. For additional analysis, I implemented a quick loop over medical approach fields to generate possible outcomes for a patient with a known health status and history. The ultimate goal is to provide treatment advice based on the predictions made by the model.
